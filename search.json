Rather, it is a tool that can help make projects reproducible by solving one small part of the problem: it records the version of R + R packages being used in a project, and provides tools for reinstalling the declared versions of those packages in a project. Ultimately, making a project reproducible requires some thoughtfulness from the user: what does it mean for a particular project to be reproducible, and how can renv (and other tools) be used to accomplish that particular goal of reproducibility?\nThere are a still a number of factors that can affect whether this project could truly be reproducible in the future – for example,\n\nThe results produced by a particular project might depend on other components of the system it’s being run on – for example, the operating system itself, the versions of system libraries in use, the compiler(s) used to compile R and the R packages used, and so on. Keeping a ‘stable’ machine image is a separate challenge, but Docker is one popular solution. See also [vignette(\"docker\", package = \"renv\")](../articles/docker.html) for recommendations on how Docker can be used together with renv.\nThe R packages that the project depends on may no longer be available. If your project depends on R packages available on CRAN, it’s possible those packages may be removed in the future – either by request of the package maintainer, or by the maintainers of CRAN itself. This is quite rare, but needs consideration if reproducibility of a project is paramount.\n\nIn addition, be aware that package installation may fail if a package was originally installed through a CRAN-available binary, but that binary is no longer available. renv will attempt to install the package from sources in this situation, but attempts to install from source can (and often do) fail due to missing system prerequisites for compilation of a package. The [renv::equip()](../reference/equip.html) function may be useful in these scenarios, especially on Windows: it will download external software commonly used when compiling R packages from sources, and instruct R to use that software during compilation.\nA salient example of this is the rmarkdown package, as it relies heavily on the pandoc command line utility. However, because pandoc is not bundled with the rmarkdown package (it is normally provided by RStudio, or installed separately by the user), simply restoring an renv project using rmarkdown may not be sufficient – one also needs to ensure the project is run in a environment with the correct version of pandoc available."

An R package would help in organizing where my functions go.\nConsistent documentation: I can barely remember what half of my functions do let alone the inputs and outputs. An R package provides a great consistent documentation structure and actually encourages you to document your functions.\nCode Distribution: No more emailing .R scripts! An R package gives an easy way to distribute your code for others. Especially if you put it on GitHub.\nDependency handling: No more failing scripts because library calls failed on load.

Software engineers try to make sure your code will not stop working if you use a slightly different versions.\nBut with all the software and all the dependencies eventually something will give and things will break. Even if the code runs successfully, there is a chance that the results could differ.\n\nManually comparing environments is difficult to impossible, using containers to replicate another’s computer is complex so we recommend a mid-point: ensuring package and R versions are the same each time the analysis is run"
